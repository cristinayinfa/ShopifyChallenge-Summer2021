Online photo uploader for selling photos and image gallery.

## Focus of the project
The main focus of the project was to create a simple HTML form with validation capabilites using PHP and a photo gallery to showcase all pictures uploaded using the form.

## How to use
1. Download all files
1. Create a folder named **submissions** in same directory to store all the pictures uploads, since there is no database implemtation in the project.
1. Run submit.html
    Here you can either submit a photo or check out the gallery
    -  Fill out the form to submit a picture into the gallery
    - Click on `Photo Gallery` to check the gallery
4. After filling out the form correctly and submitting you will be redirected to an "Uploaded Successfully" page where you have the option to submit another photo or check the gallery
5. Once in the photo gallery you can go back into the submit form to upload more photos!
